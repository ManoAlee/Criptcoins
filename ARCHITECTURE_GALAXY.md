# Bio-Molecular Architecture: Ψ Cognitive Engine 🌌⚛️

Welcome to the **Criptcoins Ψ** repository. This system is a high-precision biometric and financial hub designed with a "Hard Engineering" approach to security and identity.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: The Cognitive Molecule (Ψ)

The system treats identity not as a static string, but as a **dynamic molecule** that resonates between the client and the server.

### 1. Multi-Angle Bio-Symmetry (The Manifold)
During enrollment (**Sincronia Primordial**), the system projects a **Facial Manifold** consisting of 5 specific angles:
- **Frontal Resilience**: Direct gaze.
- **Right/Left Helix**: Profile captures with bio-symmetric mirroring fallback.
- **Zenith/Nadir Tilt**: High and low perspectives.

### 2. Cognitive Token Derivation (HMAC-SHA256)
Security is derived, not stored. The system calculates an ephemeral **Cognitive Token** for every session:
- $Token = HMAC_K(PIN \parallel Context \parallel Permission \parallel Timestamp)$
- $K = Hash(PIN \parallel Seed)$
If the observation context (IP, Time, Module) changes, the token **collapses**, instantly losing resonance and denying access.

## 📡 Client-Server Vision Boundary

**Crucial Technical Note:**
This is a true Web Application. 
- **The Browser (Frontend)** is the only component that accesses the local camera. It captures frames and sends them as high-quality (320px) spectrums to the server.
- **The Server (Backend)** never touches hardware. It only performs the mathematical resonance (Topological Logic via Gauss Curvature) to identify the incoming signature.
